You want to create a one page proposal focused on your intended use of the approaches used in this course.Your one page proposal should include a 1 paragraph research statement,  your objectives, hypothesis, datasets, and statistical analysis

I intend to analyze a phytoplankton dataset from a northern temperate lake to understand changes in species assemblage over a 10-year period with respect to changing environmental variables including ice cover. The purpose of this analysis is to establish a baseline historical pattern of seasonal species assemblage dynamics, for comparison to algal spp assemblages in response to currently ongoing whole-lake manipulation experiments of the same lake. 

The dataset I'm working with is based on algal slides from Sparkling Lake, WI, which were originally collected from 1995-2008 with funding from the NTL-LTER program. I personally identified and enumerated those slides to create the dataset used for this analysis.
